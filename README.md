## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

There was a lot of styling in this project and it took me a while to name and position everything correctly. 

I learned more about flexbox and more about javascript. It was also my first time using json, and while the json format is pretty straightforward, I didn't know how to actually put that data on the page.

**Update** 17/05/2024

I returned to this project after a couple of months to clean up the code and correctly populate the data using the information in the json file. 

### Continued development

Continued development for this project would be to make more use of json/javascript for generating and storing data.
